@book{DigitalSignalProcessing,
abstract = {From the Publisher:This is undoubtedly the most accessible book on digital signal processing (DSP) available to the beginner. Using intuitive explanations and well-chosen examples, this book gives you the tools to develop a fundamental understanding of DSP theory. The author covers the essential mathematics by explaining the meaning and significance of the key DSP equations. Comprehensive in scope, and gentle in approach, the book will help you achieve a thorough grasp of the basics and move gradually to more sophisticated DSP concepts and applications.},

@article{Karplus1983,
abstract = {A digital real-time synthesis technique is described that can be implemented readily and inexpensively on almost any computer, including microprocessors. Not only are the algorithms simple to implement in software, but hardware realizations are easily done. Despite the simplicity of the techniques, the sound is surprisingly rich and natural. For musicians interested primarily in performing and composing music, rather than designing instruments, these algorithms provide a welcome new technique. For those interested in instrument design, they open a new field of effective techniques to explore.},
