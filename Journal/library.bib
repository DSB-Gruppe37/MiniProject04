abstract = {From the Publisher:This is undoubtedly the most accessible book on digital signal processing (DSP) available to the beginner. Using intuitive explanations and well-chosen examples, this book gives you the tools to develop a fundamental understanding of DSP theory. The author covers the essential mathematics by explaining the meaning and significance of the key DSP equations. Comprehensive in scope, and gentle in approach, the book will help you achieve a thorough grasp of the basics and move gradually to more sophisticated DSP concepts and applications.},

Specific topics emphasized are Thevenin Equivalent Circuits, Nodal and Mesh Analysis, Op-Amp Circuits, and Phasor Analysis. Furthermore the text is enhanced with great support to developing fundamental skills by adding similar-type skill problems. New and additional features include: additions to the IM containing worked-out solutions to many exercises; updated ABET section of the IM to reflect the latest changes to Criteria 2000; improved SM to include worked-out solutions showing key intermediate steps with rationale, and where appropriate, METLAB solutions"--Provided by publisher},

If you'd like to create the next must-have product, this unique book is the perfect place to start. Both a creative and practical primer, it explores the platforms you can use to develop hardware or software, discusses design concepts that will make your products eye-catching and appealing, and shows you ways to scale up from a single prototype to mass production. This book helps software engineers, web designers, product designers, and electronics engineers start designing products using the Internet-of-Things approach; explains how to combine sensors, servos, robotics, Arduino chips, and more with various networks or the Internet, to create interactive, cutting-edge devices; provides an overview of the necessary steps to take your idea from concept through production. The Internet of things : an overview -- Design principles for connected devices -- Internet principles -- Thinking about prototyping -- Prototyping embedded devices -- Prototyping the physical design -- Prototyping online components -- Techniques for writing embedded code -- Business models -- Moving to manufacture -- Ethics.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Problems At any time, important people in and around government could attend to a long list of problems. People in transportation, for instance, could conceivably be examining the costs of regulation, infrastructure deterioration, automobile safety issues, production of a new supersonic airplane, the potential collapse of rail service in one or another section of the country, deficiencies in commuter movement, and the costs and shortages of energy. Obviously, they pay atten-tion to some potential problems and ignore others. This chapter considers how problems capture the attention of these people. Sometimes their attention is af-fected by a more or less systematic indicator of a problem. At other times, a dramatic event seizes their attention, or feedback from the operation of existing programs suggests that not all is well. But problems are also not entirely self-evident. How people define something as a problem is worth some considera-tion. INDICATORS Fairly often, problems come to the attention of governmental decision makers not through some sort of political pressure or perceptual slight of hand but be-cause some more or less systematic indicator simply shows that there is a prob-lem out there. Such indicators abound in the political world because both gov-ernmental and nongovernmental agencies routinely monitor various activities and events: highway deaths, disease rates, immunization rates, consumer prices, commuter and intercity ridership, costs of entitlement programs, infant mortality rates, and many others. For example, administrators of health man-power programs monitor the number of physicians being produced by medical},

abstract = {This book is about designing and implementing digital systems. The hardware description language VHDL is used to both describe and verify a system's design. Programmable logic devices (PLDs) are used for hardware implementation. To proceed from a system's description in VHDL to its realization in a PLD requires the use of a number of computer-aided engineering (CAE) software tools. These tools automate much of the traditional design and debugging of a digital system. The methodology that uses these techniques and tools is referred to in this book as the VHDL/PLD design methodology.},

@article{Atmel2015,
abstract = {9164B–AUTO–07/15 2 1. Modulation Modulation refers to the act of adding the message signal to some form of carrier. The carrier, by definition, is a higher frequency signal whose phase, frequency, amplitude, or some combination thereof, is varied proportionally to the message. This change can be detected and recovered (demodulated) at the other end of the communication channel. There are a number of ways this can be done but for simplicity we will only look at Amplitude Modulation (AM), On-Off Keying (a variation on AM), and Frequency Modulation (FM). Modulation is typically carried out in hardware, but that subject is beyond the scope of this document.},
